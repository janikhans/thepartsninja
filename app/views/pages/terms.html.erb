("<strong>thepartsninja</strong>" or "<strong>we</strong>" or "<strong>us</strong>"). Please carefully read these Terms of Use ("<strong>Terms</strong>") so you understand how we operate this Site, what we can offer and how we can work together. Please also read our <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> and <a href="/copyright">Copyright and IP Policy</a>. By using the Site and the thepartsninja Services (even if you're just visiting), you are agreeing to the Terms and Privacy Policy posted at the time of your visit.</p>

    <p>thepartsninja offers photo and video storage, story creation products and sharing services (collectively referred to as "<strong>thepartsninja Services</strong>") that are offered via the Site, other social media, mobile services and mobile applications.</p>

    <h3>Our Customers</h3>

    <p><strong>The Site is open to anyone 13 years of age or older</strong>, but some of the thepartsninja Services are only available to registered members ("<strong>Members</strong>"). You can visit the Site without registering and we will consider you a "<strong>User</strong>."</p>

    <h3>Membership Responsibilities</h3>

    <p>When you become a Member, you agree to the following:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>You have provided true information when you registered to be a Member;</li>
        <li>You have given us a valid email address, and we may confirm upon registration, or at any time thereafter, via a confirming e-mail which may require a response to complete your registration or keep it active;</li>
        <li>You will notify us if something changes;</li>
        <li>You are 13 years of age or older;</li>
        <li>You are not breaking any laws when you use the thepartsninja Services; and</li>
        <li>You will not violate these Terms as a Member.</li>
    </ul>

We recommend using a combination of numbers, symbols and lower and upper case letters to create a secure password.</p>

    <p>thepartsninja reserves the right to terminate your Membership at any time (even if you've paid), without warning for any or no reason, with or without prior notice or explanation and <strong>without liability</strong>, and can even take legal action if needed.</p>

    <p>For example, please note that it is our policy to terminate the accounts of Members who repeatedly infringe the intellectual property rights of others. We have a similar policy for Members who violate these Terms or commit illegal acts using the Site or thepartsninja Services—although we may, in our discretion, instead deny, restrict or suspend access to all or any part of the Site or thepartsninja Services or terminate a Member's account when something similar occurs.</p>

    <p>You may cease use of the thepartsninja Services at any time. Even after you are no longer a Member, you will still be responsible for the promises you have made to us about your Content (defined below). You'll be responsible for any damages that result from your breaking those promises as further outlined below.</p>
